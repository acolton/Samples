# Samples
This Repository contains code samples that I have created for various projects.  Confidential information has been replaced with x.
The following is a brief description of each file:

- CaseStatusApp.R - This R code retrieves data from a database as well as user input and calculates the length of time a given set of cases was assigned a particular status (e.g., assigned, work in progress etc.)
- ITServiceCatalog.js - This jQuery code retrieves data from several SharePoint lists and outputs it to a SharePoint hosted website.
- ServiceDashboard.R - This R code retrieves information from various databases through a Java API, the data is then processed and displayed to a real-time dashboard for Service Desk metrics. 
- VideoRepositorySearch.js - This jQuery code collects data on user searches and displays videos appropriate to the search, as well as saving search and user data back to a SharePoint list.
